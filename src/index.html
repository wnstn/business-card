  <p>I'm currently searching for 10-15 hours a week of moonlighting work.</p>
  <p>I am perfectly comfortable jumping into legacy, dusty codebases to do maintenance, but I also work regularly in modern single-page, modular apps. I love the challenge of responsive web design and I've spent time doing accessibility remediation for major corporations (I also helped write and build <a href="http://accessibility.voxmedia.com/">Vox Media's Accessibility Guidelines</a>).</p>
  <p>I currently (happily) work at Vox Media on the revenue products team. I'm seeking moonlighting work for fun and new challenges. If you have a project that could use a little bit of senior help, I'd love to chat. My hourly rate is $120, but if the project is well-scoped I can discuss project-based pricing.</p>
  <p>Send me <a href="mailto:hello@wnstn.com">an email</a> if you're looking for devs, I'd love to chat.</p>
  <p></p>
